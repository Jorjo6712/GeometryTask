## Square
A square is a shape with four equal sides and four right angles. The defining features of a square are:
- All sides are of equal length.
- All angles are 90 degrees.
- The perimeter is calculated as `4 * side length`.
- The area is calculated as `side length^2`.

## Rectangle
A rectangle is a shape with opposite sides equal and four right angles. The defining features of a rectangle are:
- Opposite sides are of equal length.
- All angles are 90 degrees.
- The perimeter is calculated as `2 * (length + width)`.
- The area is calculated as `length * width`.

## Parallelogram
A parallelogram is a shape with opposite sides parallel and equal in length. The defining features of a parallelogram are:
- Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
- Opposite angles are equal.
- The perimeter is calculated as `2 * (side1 + side2)`.
- The area is calculated as `base * height` or `side1 * side2 * sin(angle)`, where angle is the angle between the sides.

## Trapezoid
A trapezoid (or trapezium) is a shape with at least one pair of parallel sides. The defining features of a trapezoid are:
- At least one pair of sides is parallel.
- The non-parallel sides are called legs.
- The perimeter is calculated as the sum of all sides.
- The area is calculated as `1/2 * (base1 + base2) * height`.

## Right-Angled Triangle
A right-angled triangle is a triangle with one angle equal to 90 degrees. The defining features of a right-angled triangle are:
- One angle is 90 degrees.
- The side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse.
- The other two sides are called legs.
- The perimeter is calculated as the sum of all three sides.
- The area is calculated as `1/2 * leg1 * leg2`.
